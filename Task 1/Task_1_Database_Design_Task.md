Let us design a survey completion system! Users will be able to log in and complete surveys.

**Background**: This task is similar to the things you will be potentially doing if you are hired. Our database has already been created (so there's no need to worry about us claiming the concept you have designed) and this task is just for us to see how you think when creating a simple database. Please keep in mind that we do not expect you to spend ages on this task and therefore we are not expecting the moon! We would advise you to spend around 20 minutes?

We would like you to structure the database with a particular technology in mind (SQL). Whichever SQL dialect you choose (e.g. MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle etc) is completely up to you. This is just for us to see your understanding with relational databases. We are looking for clarity in communication, ability to turn abstract concepts into practical steps, and systematic thinking.

Here are the requirements:
-	Required fields for each survey are survey name, survey date completion, survey questions and survey answers (feel free to add any other fields depending on how you tackle the following tasks).
-	We have registered users (hint: think about what you will be storing in the users table).
-	Users can partially complete surveys and come back to it later.
-	User can delete their responses if they want to. 

**Questions**
1)	As per the above provided requirements, define the minimal database structure which can satisfy these requirements. No SQL queries are required, we would just like to know what are the required tables and fields? - feel free to reshuffle the structure of the database! As long as the required fields are captured, that is fine by us :)
2)	Define what steps are required to complete a survey (i.e. database flow). Suppose the user is already logged in and has a list of surveys to complete, user information is available globally.
3)	Describe the database flow for deleting responses.

You can submit your answers however you like (e.g. under each of the questions or creating a new markdown file). Just make sure this is communicated in the main README file.
