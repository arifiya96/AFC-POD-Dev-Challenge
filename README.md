# AFC-POD-Dev-Challenge
Dev challenge for shortlisted candidates

All the instructions for each particular task will be in the MD file in each of the task folders. Begin by forking this repo and making a copy on your local machine.

Here is a guide to how long we realistically feel that each task should take. We understand that you have other commitments and things you need to get done. <br>
- Task 1 - 20 minutes. This may depend on how much experience you have with backend technology stacks and databases. 
- Task 2 - 30 minutes. Some developers may take longer but this will depend on experience. You may take a while to do this because you are referring to the docs. Please do not worry about styling, a MVP submission will do. 
- Task 3 - 15 minutes. If you have seen this problem before, this may not take long.

Estimated timeframe: 1 hour 5 minutes.

These are guidelines on what we are looking for in our submissions:
- Code is human-readable and easy to understand.
- Clear and holistic, systematic approach to problem solving.
- Clear demonstration of your solid functional rooting in technical concepts behind scalable, reliable, and privacy-preserving web-based applications & architectures.
- The accompanying file of markdown answers is well structured and communicates your thoughts clearly and concisely.
- The styling of code is consistent and technical choices are well communicated.
- Any changes to file structure are also communicated in the README.

You will be given the first part of the interview to talk us through each task. Please make sure your final submission is ready at least 24 hours before your interview. Good luck!
