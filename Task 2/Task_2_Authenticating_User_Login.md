-	Set up a SQL database (MySQL preferably but you may use another dialect if you wish). **Only one table is necessary.** You can call it something like 'users'. Define which fields are necessary in order for this to work. 
-	Set up the authentication flow from the given HTML pages (Login.html, signup.html, and homepage.html). **When writing the logic, please do it in PHP**
-	If successful, the login page should take you to the homepage. If the user has not signed up, please authenticate a user in the signup page. Create all the appropriate logic.
- Create a logout function. 

**What we are looking for**

-	Do not worry about the CSS or styling. We are not expecting front-end design ability. We want to see how you **connect HTML components to PHP classes and functions.** Although, if you have time, you are more than welcome to style the components. You will not be penalised for sticking with the boiler templates provided.
-	Please remember this is just a way for us to see how you approach problems and work on shared code. 
-   You can add as many files and components as you like. As long as it works during the demo, we're happy with whatever approach you wish to take.
